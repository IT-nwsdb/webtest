Changes on 2025-10-29:
- Updated system.js: handleAddCategoryClick now saves bulk meta fields (account number, monthly bill,
  officer telephone, supplier name, and location) along with the quantity.
- For bulk categories, de-duplication is now by (category + account number), so you can add multiple
  quantities under the same category for different account numbers, keeping other info intact.
- After adding a bulk entry, the account number and quantity fields are reset for quick data entry,
  while supplier name/location/monthly bill/officer tel are preserved as requested.
